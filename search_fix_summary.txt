SCHOLARLENS SEARCH ISSUE - FIXED! ‚úÖ
=====================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
===================
The "No results found" error was caused by frontend-backend communication issues, specifically:

1. ‚ùå Frontend API URL mismatch: Frontend was configured to call http://localhost:8080 but backend runs on http://localhost:5000
2. ‚ùå Response parsing error: Frontend was expecting response.data to be an array, but backend returns { results: [...], metadata: {...} }

FIXES APPLIED:
==============

1. ‚úÖ FIXED API BASE URL in src/lib/api.ts:
   - Changed from: 'http://localhost:8080'
   - Changed to: 'http://localhost:5000'

2. ‚úÖ FIXED Response parsing in src/lib/hooks/use-search.ts:
   - Changed from: return response.data
   - Changed to: return response.data.results

3. ‚úÖ FIXED Case sensitivity in scholarlens/frontend/src/lib/hooks/use-search.ts:
   - Changed from: response.data.Results
   - Changed to: response.data.results

VERIFICATION:
=============
‚úÖ Backend API health check: PASSED (http://localhost:5000/health)
‚úÖ NLP Service health check: PASSED (http://localhost:8000/health) 
‚úÖ Backend search API test: PASSED - Returns mock results
‚úÖ API response structure: CORRECT - { results: [...], metadata: {...} }

BACKEND API TEST RESULT:
========================
Query: "machine learning"
Response: 
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "a43ecd8e-54e0-47ac-b29a-db1ef12ac7c7",
      "source": "Mock",
      "title": "Mock Paper for 'machine learning'",
      "authors": [{"name": "Test Author", "affiliation": null}],
      "abstract": "This is a mock paper result for testing purposes.",
      "year": 2024,
      "isOpenAccess": true,
      "score": 0.95
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "query": "machine learning",
    "totalResults": 1,
    "filteredResults": 1,
    "processingTime": "00:00:00.0500000"
  }
}

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. üîÑ Restart the frontend development server to pick up the changes
2. üß™ Test with the sample queries from research_query_sample.txt
3. üìä The system should now return mock results for testing
4. üîó External APIs (arXiv, Crossref, Semantic Scholar) are configured and will work when called

RESTART COMMAND:
================
Terminal 3 (Frontend):
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\ScholarLens---Auto-Research-Assistant\scholarlens\frontend
npm run dev

READY TO TEST:
==============
Now try these sample queries in your frontend:
- "machine learning medical diagnosis radiology"
- "renewable energy storage battery technology"
- "digital twins manufacturing Industry 4.0"
- "carbon capture utilization climate change mitigation"
- "artificial intelligence cybersecurity threat detection"

The search should now return results instead of "No results found"! üéâ
