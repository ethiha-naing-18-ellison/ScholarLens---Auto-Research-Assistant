TIPS FOR BETTER SEARCH RESULTS:
==============================
âœ“ Use specific technical terms rather than general words
âœ“ Combine 2-4 relevant keywords for targeted results
âœ“ Include domain-specific terms (e.g., "neural networks" vs "AI")
âœ“ Try both broad and narrow queries to explore different aspects
âœ“ Use recent year ranges (2019+) for cutting-edge research
âœ“ Enable "Open Access Only" for freely available papers
âœ“ Start with 25 results, then adjust based on relevance

GENERATING REPORTS:
==================
After searching, you can:
1. Select specific papers from results
2. Generate comprehensive research reports
3. Get AI-powered summaries
4. Create visualizations and charts
5. Export findings in multiple formats

ACCESS URLs:
===========
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend API: http://localhost:5000
API Documentation: http://localhost:5000/swagger
NLP Service: http://localhost:8000

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
â€¢ "No results found" â†’ Try broader search terms or different year ranges
â€¢ Slow results â†’ Reduce max results or check internet connection
â€¢ Limited open access â†’ Disable "Open Access Only" filter
â€¢ Technical errors â†’ Check all services are running (see RUN_COMMANDS.txt)
